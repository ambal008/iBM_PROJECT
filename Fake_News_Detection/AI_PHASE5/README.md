#Install all the required packages
Tensorflow is a python library used to build various models 
scikit-learn is used to split the dataset into train and test split.It is also used to find the classification report and accuracy score.

#usage

import tensorflow as tf

import sklearn 

#then implement the various layers one by one to implement the LSTM(Long Term Short Memory) Model.It is a classification model used to classify the data as True data or Fake data by training the model with various feature extraction.


#Dataset Used

Here, the dataset we used is a kaggle dataset which mostly covers the topics during the U.S Government election.
